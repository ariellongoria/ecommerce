### This API includes routing for the logging, creating, updating, and deleting of products, categories and tags that might be used on an ecommerce site.

## Usage

For all products, categories, and tags use the general GET routes:

One can look up specific products, categories, and tags through the GET routes:

-   `/api/products/:id`
-   `/api/categories/:id`
-   `/api/tags/:id`

Update any product, category, or tag through PUT, DELETE, and POST routes:

-   `/api/products/:id`
